-  Hello, my name is Paula M Duncan.  I have worked two years to obtain a Salesforce Administrator certification.  Now, I am looking to do volunteer assignments in the 
Salesforce community.
I have obtained Salesforce internships in both the Administrator arena and the Platform Developer 1 area using Apex, Aura, and Lightning Web Components.
